# Only enable if your nodes are proxmox LXC nodes, make sure to configure your proxmox nodes

# Please read https://gist.github.com/triangletodd/02f595cd4c0dc9aac5f7763ca2264185 before using this.
# Most notably, your containers must be privileged, and must not have nesting set to true.
# Please note this script disables most of the security of lxc containers, with the trade off being that lxc
# containers are significantly more resource efficient compared to full VMs.
# Mixing and matching VMs and lxc containers is not supported, ymmv if you want to do this.
# I would only really recommend using this if you have particularly low powered proxmox nodes where the overhead of
# VMs would use a significant portion of your available resources.

# Only enable this if you have set up your own container registry to act as a mirror / pull-through cache
# (harbor / nexus / docker's official registry / etc).
# Can be beneficial for larger dev/test environments (for example if you're getting rate limited by docker hub),
# or air-gapped environments where your nodes don't have internet access after the initial setup
# (which is still needed for downloading the k3s binary and such).
# k3s's documentation about private registries here: https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry
custom_registries: false
# The registries can be authenticated or anonymous, depending on your registry server configuration.
# If they allow anonymous access, simply remove the following bit from custom_registries_yaml
#   configs:
#     "registry.domain.com":

#         username: yourusername

# The following is an example that pulls all images used in this playbook through your private registries.
# It also allows you to pull your own images from your private registry, without having to use imagePullSecrets
# in your deployments.
# If all you need is your own images and you don't care about caching the docker/quay/ghcr.io images,
# you can just remove those from the mirrors: section.
